/**
 * Busiest Time in The Mall
 * <p>
 * The Westfield Mall management is trying to figure out what the busiest moment at the mall was last year.
 * You’re given data extracted from the mall’s door detectors. Each data point is represented as an integer array whose
 * size is 3. The values at indices 0, 1 and 2 are the timestamp, the count of visitors, and whether the visitors
 * entered or exited the mall (0 for exit and 1 for entrance), respectively. Here’s an example of a data point:
 * [ 1440084737, 4, 0 ].
 * <p>
 * Note that time is given in a Unix format called Epoch, which is a nonnegative integer holding the number of seconds
 * that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970.
 * <p>
 * Given an array, data, of data points, write a function findBusiestPeriod that returns the time at which the mall
 * reached its busiest moment last year. The return value is the timestamp, e.g. 1480640292. Note that if there is more
 * than one period with the same visitor peak, return the earliest one.
 * <p>
 * Assume that the array data is sorted in an ascending order by the timestamp. Explain your solution and analyze its
 * time and space complexities.

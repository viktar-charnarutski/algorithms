/**
 * Fraudulent Activity Notifications
 * <p>
 * HackerLand National Bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fraudulent account activity.
 * If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to 2x the client's median spending for a
 * trailing number of days, they send the client a notification about potential fraud. The bank doesn't send the client
 * any notifications until they have at least that trailing number of prior days' transaction data.
 * <p>
 * Given the number of trailing days d and a client's total daily expenditures for a period of n days, find and print the
 * number of times the client will receive a notification over all n days.

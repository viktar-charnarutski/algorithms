/**
 * Intersection of two Sorted Linked Lists.
 * <p>
 * Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and return a new list representing the intersection
 * of the two lists. The new list should be made with its own memory â€” the original lists should not be changed.
 * <p>
 * For example, let the first linked list be 1->2->3->4->6 and second linked list be 2->4->6->8,
 * then your function should create and return a third list as 2->4->6.

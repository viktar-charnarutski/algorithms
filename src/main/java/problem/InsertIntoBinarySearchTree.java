 * 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree
 * <p>
 * Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into
 * the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in
 * the original BST.
 * <p>
 * Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion.
 * You can return any of them.

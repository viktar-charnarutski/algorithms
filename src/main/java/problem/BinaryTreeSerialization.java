/**
 * 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
 * <p>
 * In Computer Science, serialization is the process of converting objects or data structures into a sequence
 * (or series) of characters that can be stored easily in a file / database table or transmitted across a network.
 * Serialized objects need to be de-serialized to create a semantically identical clone of the original object, before
 * being used in programs. You're given the root node of a binary tree - TreeNode root in the method serializeTree.
 * This method should serialize the binary tree and output a String str, which is then used as an input parameter for
 * the method restoreTree. restoreTree should create a Binary Tree that is structurally identical to the one you
 * serialized and return the root node of the tree. Your task is to fill in the logic for these 2 methods.
 * <p>
 * Don't worry about passing the serialized String to restoreTree - that will be done automatically when you run your
 * code. Feel free to use any notation you prefer when serializing the binary tree. The choice of traversal algorithm
 * is also open - but try and limit the time complexity of both methods to O(n).

 * Distance between two nodes in a Binary Tree

 * Given the root of a Binary Tree  and 2 integers that represent the data values of any two TreeNodes present in the
 * tree, write a method - getNodeDistance that returns the distance between the nodes. You can assume that the given
 * keys exist in the tree. The distance between two nodes is defined as the minimum number of edges that must be
 * traversed to travel between the two nodes.

/**
 * Lily's Homework
 * <p>
 * Whenever George asks Lily to hang out, she's busy doing homework. George wants to help her finish it faster, but he's
 * in over his head! Can you help George understand Lily's homework so she can hang out with him?
 * <p>
 * Consider an array of n distinct integers. George can swap any two elements of the array any number of times. An
 * array is beautiful if the sum of |arr[i] - arr[i - 1]| among 0 < i < n is minimal.
 * <p>
 * Given the array arr, determine and return the minimum number of swaps that should be performed in order to make the
 * array beautiful.

 * Robot in a Grid
 * <p>
 * Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns.
 * <p>
 * The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that
 * the robot cannot step on them.
 * <p>
 * Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

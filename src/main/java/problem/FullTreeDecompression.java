/**
 * Full Tree Decompression
 * <p>
 * Given a String that represents a Binary Tree, write a method - decompressTree that decompresses that tree
 * (reconstructs the tree) and returns the root TreeNode. The compression algorithm included traversing the tree level
 * by level, from the left to the right. The TreeNode's data values were appended to the String, delimited by commas.
 * Also, null TreeNodes were denoted by appending an asterisk - *. The input String denotes the structure of a Full
 * Binary Tree - i.e. a tree that is structurally balanced. However, the reconstructed tree may not be a full tree as
 * the String included * characters, which represent null TreeNodes.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * You can assume that if a Binary Tree contains k levels, the compressed String will contain 2k-1 elements - either
 * numbers or *.

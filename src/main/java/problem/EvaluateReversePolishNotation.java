/**
 * 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
 *
 * Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
 *
 * Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
 * The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there
 * won't be any divide by zero operation.

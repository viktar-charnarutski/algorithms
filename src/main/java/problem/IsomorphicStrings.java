 * 205. Isomorphic Strings
 * <p>
 * Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
 * <p>
 * Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
 * <p>
 * All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.
 * No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

 * Bigger is Greater
 * <p>
 * Lexicographical order is often known as alphabetical order when dealing with strings. A string is greater than
 * another string if it comes later in a lexicographically sorted list.
 * <p>
 * Given a word, create a new word by swapping some or all of its characters. This new word must meet two criteria:
 * <p>
 * 1. It must be greater than the original word
 * 2. It must be the smallest word that meets the first condition

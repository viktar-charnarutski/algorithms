/**
 * 450. Delete Node in a BST
 * <p>
 * Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
 * <p>
 * Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
 * <p>
 *  - Search for a node to remove.
 *  - If the node is found, delete the node.

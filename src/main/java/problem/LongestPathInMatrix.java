 * Find the longest path in a matrix with given constraints
 * <p>
 * Given a n*n matrix where all numbers are distinct, find the maximum length path (starting from any cell)
 * such that all cells along the path are in increasing order with a difference of 1.
 * <p>
 * We can move in 4 directions from a given cell (i, j), i.e., we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1) or (i-1, j)
 * or (i, j-1) with the condition that the adjacent cells have a difference of 1.

/**
 * Word Count Engine
 * <p>
 * Implement a document scanning function wordCountEngine, which receives a string document and returns a list of all
 * unique words in it and their number of occurrences, sorted by the number of occurrences in a descending order.
 * If two or more words have the same count, they should be sorted according to their order in the original sentence.
 * Assume that all letters are in english alphabet. You function should be case-insensitive, so for instance, the words
 * “Perfect” and “perfect” should be considered the same word.
 * <p>
 * The engine should strip out punctuation (even in the middle of a word) and use whitespaces to separate words.
 * <p>
 * Analyze the time and space complexities of your solution. Try to optimize for time while keeping a polynomial space
 * complexity.

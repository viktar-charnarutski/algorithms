 * 337. House Robber III
 *
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area,
 * called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house.
 * After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree".
 * It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

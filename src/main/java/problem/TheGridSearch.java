/**
 * The Grid Search.
 * <p>
 * Given a 2D array of digits or grid, try to find the occurrence of a given 2D pattern of digits. For example,
 * consider the following grid:
 * <p>
 * 1234567890
 * 0987654321
 * 1111111111
 * 1111111111
 * 2222222222
 * <p>
 * Assume we need to look for the following 2D pattern array:
 * <p>
 * 876543
 * 111111
 * 111111
 * <p>
 * The 2D pattern begins at the second row and the third column of the grid. The pattern is said to be present in the
 * grid.

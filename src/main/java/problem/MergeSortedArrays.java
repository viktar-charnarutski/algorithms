/**
 * Merge Sorted Arrays
 * <p>
 * The idea behind the classic Mergesort algorithm is to divide an array in half, sort each half, and then use
 * a merge() method to merge the two halves into a single sorted array.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Implement the merge() method that takes in two sorted arrays and returns a third sorted array that contains elements
 * of both the input arrays.
 * <p>
 * You can assume that the input arrays will always be sorted in ascending order and can have different sizes.

/**
 * 904. Fruit Into Baskets
 * <p>
 * In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].
 * <p>
 * You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:
 * <p>
 * Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
 * Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.
 * Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2,
 * then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.
 * <p>
 * You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one
 * type of fruit each.
 * <p>
 * What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?

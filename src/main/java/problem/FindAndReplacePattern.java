/**
 * 890. Find and Replace Pattern
 * <p>
 * You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.
 * <p>
 * A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the
 * pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
 * <p>
 * (Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter,
 * and no two letters map to the same letter.)
 * <p>
 * Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern.
 * <p>
 * You may return the answer in any order.

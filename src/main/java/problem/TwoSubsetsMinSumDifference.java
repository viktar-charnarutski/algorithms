/**
 * Two Subsets Minimum Sum Difference
 * <p>
 * Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2
 * such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
 * <p>
 * If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements,
 * Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

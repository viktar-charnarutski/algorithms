/**
 * 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 * <p>
 * Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 * <p>
 * (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 * <p>
 * You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
 * <p>
 * You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
 * <p>
 * Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

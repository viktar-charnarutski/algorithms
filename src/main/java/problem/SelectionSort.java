/**
 * Selection Sort
 * <p>
 * Selection sort offers improved performance over bubble sort, especially for arrays with a large number of elements.
 * Where bubble sort accumulated the largest elements towards the end of the array, selection sort accumulates the
 * smallest elements at the beginning of the array.
 * <p>
 * Write a method that uses the selection sort algorithm to sort an input array of integers. See the hints and click the
 * red colored links for additonal details on the algorithm.

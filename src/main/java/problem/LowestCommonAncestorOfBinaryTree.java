 * 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
 * <p>
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q
 * as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * <p>
 * Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

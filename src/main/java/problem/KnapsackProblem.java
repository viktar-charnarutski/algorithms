/**
 * Knapsack Problem
 * <p>
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value
 * in the knapsack.
 * <p>
 * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated
 * with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value
 * subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

/**
 * 75. Sort Colors
 * <p>
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same
 * color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
 * <p>
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
 * <p>
 * Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

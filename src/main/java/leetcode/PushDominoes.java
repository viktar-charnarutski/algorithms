/**
 * 838. Push Dominoes
 *
 * There are N dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright.
 *
 * In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
 *
 * After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left.
 *
 * Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
 *
 * When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
 *
 * For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling
 * or already fallen domino.
 *
 * Given a string "S" representing the initial state. S[i] = 'L', if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;
 * S[i] = 'R', if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right; S[i] = '.', if the i-th domino has not been pushed.
 *
 * Return a string representing the final state.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: ".L.R...LR..L.."
 * Output: "LL.RR.LLRRLL.."

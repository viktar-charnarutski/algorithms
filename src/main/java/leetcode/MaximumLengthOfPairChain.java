/**
 * 646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain
 * <p>
 * You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.
 * <p>
 * Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c.
 * Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.
 * <p>
 * Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed.
 * You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

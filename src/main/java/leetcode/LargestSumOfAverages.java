 * 813. Largest Sum of Averages
 * <p>
 * We partition a row of numbers A into at most K adjacent (non-empty) groups,
 * then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?
 * <p>
 * Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.
